# Assignment 2

## Your Implementation
Please create a local copy of this template Colab's Notebook:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FfXDvRMALIsd-IzPdf_Fn92OLVHjSY9I#scrollTo=3-7FX8tW0y7k)

The assignment's instructions are there; you can just follow the notebook.

## Testing
Copy the content of the `tests.py` file (as is) to the designated code cell in the notebook and run it.
It will produce and download the `results.json` file with the results of the tests.
Please replace the existing results file of this repo with your current one!

## Autograding for This Assignment

This assignment uses an autograding system that provides feedback a bit differently than usual. Here's what to keep in mind:

* **Your total score out of 150** is the most important metric. This score accurately reflects your performance.
* **Ignore the global checkmarks (‚úÖ) or Xs (‚ùå) next to the tests.** These are based on a separate internal grading scale and might not accurately represent your performance for this assignment.

Here's why: While the maximum achievable score is 100 points, the autograder might use a system with higher thresholds. This means you could get a perfect score (100 points) but see an (‚ùå) next to some tests (or even globally). Don't be concerned about that!

Just focus on your total score out of 150. That's the one that truly tells you how well you did!


## Submission
- **Notebook Link**: In the `notebook_link.txt` file, add the URL to your assignment's notebook, following the format provided in the example.
- **Access**: Ensure the link has edit permissions enabled to allow modifications if needed.
- **Deadline**: <font color='green'>21/05/2024, 23:55</font>.
- **Platform**: Continue using GitHub for submissions. 

## General instructions
- Please commit and push **only** the `results.json` and `notebook_link.txt` files. 
- Please avoid changing/deleting files under the .github folder, as this may interfere with the auto-grading operation.

GOOD LUCK! ü§ó
